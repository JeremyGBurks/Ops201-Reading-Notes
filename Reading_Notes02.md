## Ops-201 Reading 02: "Github"

### Summary
Github is "a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration." It allows people to work collaboratively on projects from all over the world. This introductory reading outlines what a repository is and how to create one. Repos can contain folders, files, images and anything your project needs. They often contain a README file with info on your projects. This reading also outlines the process of Branching which lets you have different versions of your repo at one time, and making and commiting changes to a repo. There is a section on "Opening a pull request" which are the heart of collaboration on Github. When you open a pull request you are proposing changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution. 



### New Vocab
**Repository:** Repositories contain folders, files, images, videos, and data sets--anything your project needs.

## Ops-201 Reading 02: "VS Code"

### Summary
VS code is "a lightweight but powerful source code editor" that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js out of the box. The intro videos included "getting started" which covered the basics of VS Code and its functions. The video "Code Editing" introduced the ability to edit and run basic code in VS Code. In the video titled "Productivity Tips" the ability to customize VS Code and make import keyboard shortcuts from different code types was interesting. A takeaway from this site/videos was that this particular program/app is highly customizable and able to allow you to write and edit many different types of code. You can download numerous helpful extensions to further increase the functionality of VS Code.

### New Vocab
VS Code Extensions: extension packages that enable different coding languages, themes, debuggers, commands, and more

### Why This Reading Matters
This reading matters because this week we will start using Bash scripting and will be also using some python at some point in the program. VM Code is a powerful tool that will allow us to write and edit code easily.
