## How to remove malware from your Windows PC

### Summary
Step 1--Enter safe mode (disconnect from the internet). 
Step 2--Delete temporary files before doing a virus scan (this will make the scan complete quicker). Go to "Disk cleanup". 
Step 3--Download malware scanners. There are two types of antivirus programs; real time which constantly runs in the background, and on demand which manually searches when you open the program and enable the scan. "You should have only one real-time antivirus program installed at a time, but you can have many on-demand scanners installed to run scans with multiple programs, thereby ensuring that if one program misses something a different one might find it." This article suggests that if you think you have malware to run an on-demand followed by a full system scan.  
Step 4--This section of the article is a step-by-step guide on using "Malwarebytes" to scan.  
Step 5--Fix your web browser, "one common malware trait is to modify your web browser’s homepage to reinfect the PC, display advertisements, prevent browsing, and generally annoy you...Before launching your web browser, check your homepage and connection settings. Simply go to the settings window of your browser to check your homepage setting."  
Step 6--Recover your files if Windows is corrupt. If you can't seem to remove the malware or Windows isn't running properly, you may need to reinstall it. Before wiping the hard drive, copy all files to a an external USB or flash drive. Back up device drivers.
Step 7--Keep your PC clean. Make sure you have a real-time antivirus program at all times and that they are up to date. Consider using OpenDNS service to block dangerous sites. "double-check your online accounts, including those for your bank, email, and social networking sites. Look for suspicious activity and change your passwords—because some malware can capture your passwords...If you have a backup system in place that automatically backs up your files or system, consider running virus scans on the backups to confirm that they didn’t inadvertently save infections."
