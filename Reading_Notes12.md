## Introduction to pfSense-An Open Source Firewall and Router Platform

### Summary
What is pfSense? "pfSense is a free, customized distribution of FreeBSD that can turn an old computer into a full featured router and firewall."   
The article lists off the following popular uses for pfSense:
1. LAN/WAN Router
2. Internet Cafes
3. Wireless Hotspot (Captive Portal)
4. VPN Router
5. Firewall
6. DHCP / DNS Server
7. Wireless Access Point
8. Transparent Squid Proxy Server
9. Multi Wan Router or Load Balancer
10. DNS Blacklist
11. Port Forwarding / NAT (Network Address Translation)

The article goes on to explain why using pfSense with an already existing router is helpful (if your router is missing features or underperforming).  
"pfSense can also be installed on several different embedded platforms such as PC-Engines, Soekris, Alix, and others."  
It goes through what you will need to set up a pfSense router--"you'll need an old computer with at least two network cards installed". 
There is also a step-by-step guide to setting it up as well as an embedded YouTube video.
