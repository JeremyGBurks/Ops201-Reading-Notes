Bash is the shell primarily used in Linux. It combines a scripting language, as well as a host of native Linux tools to automate and manage Linux devices. 
Both Bash and PowerShell rely on the concept of the pipeline. PowerShell pipes objects, passing along the output of one cmdlet as the input for another one. This means PowerShell pushes around structured data. Bash shells push around globs of text.

## Who needs malware? IBM says most hackers just PowerShell through boxes now, leaving little in the way of footprints

### Summary
in 2018 43 per cent of the attacks analyzed utilized any sort of locally installed files. "Rather, the hackers utilized PowerShell scripts to execute their dirty deeds in memory without significantly touching file systems, if at all."
This reading was on the _power_ of PowerShell in direct to memory attacks. It stated, "...admins can no longer solely rely on detecting malicious executables and similar data on hard drives and other storage to identify cyber-intrusions."
This attack described "runs entirely in memory using PowerShell, where Microsoft's powerful scripting language can be used to do anything from harvest and steal passwords to mine cryptocurrency."
"PowerShell is useful in data collection and analysis, but it is also favored by malicious actors who use it to forego the file system and inject malicious code directly into memory, thus enhancing obfuscation, and often evading security controls designed to detect malware deployments."

### New Vocab
Malicious executable: Malicious executables generally fall into three categories based on their transport mechanism: viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. Viruses inject malicious code into existing programs, which become “infected” and, in turn, propagate the virus to other programs when executed.

### Why this reading matters in relation to topics introduced in class
This reading highlights how Powershell is important in CyberSecurity specifically with malicious attacks. This article ties into the one above as well as the Windows PowerShell material we have covered this past week.
