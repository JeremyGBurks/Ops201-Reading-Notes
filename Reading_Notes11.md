## SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

### Summary
This article starts out describing how to know if your SSD is failing. According to the article, "Unfortunately, SSD failures are hard to detect...Armed with the proper knowledge, an individual may be able to detect probable SSD failure and can take steps to intervene".   
There are some common indicators an SSD may be on its way to failing:  
1. Bad blocks--"storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions." Some common symptoms of bad blocks are: "Saving, reading, and moving files resulting in failure"; "general performance may steadily decrease, especially when handling large files."
2. File system repair
3. Crashing--"If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing."
4. Read-only mode--"In the event that an SSD will not operate except to perform read-only functions, the drive is most likely corrupted."

How to fix a failed SSD:      
Recovery options: Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system. power cycling the SSD, idling in the boot menu, updating SSD firmware, and/or updating drivers.    

The remainder of the article touches on the possibility of recovering data from a failed SSD as well as some SSD best practices.

## How to Erase a Hard Drive Using DBAN

### Summary
This article was on DBAN (Darik's Boot And Nuke). It was a full step-by-step guide on how to use this free data destruction program. Important aspects noted were:  
1. "Darik's Boot And Nuke (DBAN) is an entirely free data destruction program used to completely erase all the files on a hard drive."
2. "This includes everythingâ€”every installed application, all your personal files, and even the operating system."
3. "DBAN has to run while the operating system isn't in use so you'll need to burn the program to a disc (CD, DVD, USB) and run it from there." 

### New Vocab
Data sanitization method: "A data sanitization method is a specific way in which a data destruction program or file shredder overwrites the data on a hard drive or other storage device"

### Why this reading matters in relation to topics covered in class
We are actually using this program in our Lab 11 on Saturday so this walkthrough guide will be extremely helpful for that specific lab objective. This also ties into the overarching theme of data protection and best practices.
