## Ops-201 Reading 01: "How to Use System Restore"

### Summary 

The system restore function is an important tool that allows you to "revert to a previous software, registry, and driver config called a *restore point*." It is typically a good first step when trying to troubleshoot a major Windows OS problem. "It is a simple process that takes approximately 10-30 minutes." This function is useful due to the fact that a majority of Windows problems involve issue with software, registry, and driver config. If you have previously performed a system restore, there will also be an option to *undo system restore point*. You can also choose different restore points that were previously saved. 

### New Vocabulary
Restore Point: a backup copy of important Windows operating system (OS) files and settings that can be used to recover the system to an earlier point

### Why this matters in relation to topics introduced this week
We studied backup strategies this week which directly relates to the system restore function. It is important to have backups of both VMs and OS just in case we inadvertently cause a system critical problem and need to restore our OS to an earlier version complete with all our prior system settings.
