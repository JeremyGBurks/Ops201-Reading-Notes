## The Role of the Help Desk Professional

### Summary 
The help desk professional (hereafter referred to as HDP) is the "face" of the IT staff that customers see. The HDP is the first line of support for users, when customers experience problems it is the helpdesk they interface with first. They certainly need technical knowledge and the ability to troubleshoot problems, however, assessing problems and identifying solutions is almost more important. Their goal is resolve the problem quickly rather than ensuring the problem is resolved.
