## How To Troubleshoot-CompTIA A+

### Summary
Troubleshooting will be the most common thing you do everyday. In IT, a large part of the job is problem solving. 

 
* **Identifying information**  
_you need to understand the problem and be able to duplicate it. It is never just one thing. Often an error message, slow system, blue screen. Make sure to document these to understand the problem entirely_  
* **Think about what might have caused the problem.**  
_start with the most obvious issues. Consider every possible scenario, even ones that may not be obvious. Make a list of what all the possible problems may be._
* **Start from the top of the list testing theories that might be causing the particular issue.**  
_determine what the next steps may be to resolve the issue. If it does not work, move on to the next. If you get through your entire list and still don't know what may be happening, it may be worthwhile to call an expert._
* **Once you have identified which theories solves the problem it is time to implement the solution.**  
_sometimes this can be done quickly. If this on a production system you may only be able to may changes on a certain day at a certain time. It is also good to have a plan B and plan C just in case your change does not work as planned. You ultimately need a plan to revert back to the previous configuration if nothing goes right._
* **Once fix has been applied, you need to test and make sure you actually fixed the problem**  
_now that the problem has been implemented, you have tested, and everything is back to normal, it may be worthwhile to create preventative measures to potentially prevent this from happening again. Make sure to document this entire process for your own knowledge base so that if anyone else runs into this issue they know what to do._


### New Vocab
No new vocab was introduced in this particular reading. 


### Why this topic matters in relation to topics recently introduced
This reading ties into the recent topics relating to "The Help Desk Professional." I do think that the skill to be an effective troubleshooter can be applied to more than just strictly IT problems. I have witnessed my instructors using this during the course, as well as employed it myself when coming up against a problem. It is a universally invaluable skill.
